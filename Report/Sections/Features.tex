What does it do (show wireframe from hardcode, camera position/lookpoint moveable)

\subsection{Camera controls}
Movement of the camera position and lookpoint is done in 10-unit intervals. This interval is hardcoded and should probably be a changeable variable.

The controls for the camera are:
\begin{my_itemize}
\item a/s/q decrease the value of the x/y/z position of the camera, respectively.
\item d/w/e increase the value of the x/y/z position of the camera, respectively.
\item j/k/u decrease the value of the x/y/z position of the camera's lookpoint, respectively.
\item l/i/o increase the value of the x/y/z position of the camera's lookpoint, respectively.
\end{my_itemize}
