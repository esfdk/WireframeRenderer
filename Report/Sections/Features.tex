\section{Features}
The core of the wireframe renderer takes a list of triangles (consisting of three vertices) and renders them to a Windows Forms window according to the Near, Far, Aspect Ratio and Field of View variables for the camera. 

The renderer loads a hardcoded pyramid shape of five vertices making up four triangles. The position of the camera and the point the camera is looking at are changeable using the controls described in \ref{CC}.

\subsection{Camera controls}
\label{CC}
Movement of the camera position and look point is done in 10-unit intervals. This interval is hardcoded and should probably be a changeable variable or a smaller value.

The controls for the camera are:
\begin{my_itemize}
\item a/s/q decrease the value of the x/y/z position of the camera, respectively.
\item d/w/e increase the value of the x/y/z position of the camera, respectively.
\item j/k/u decrease the value of the x/y/z position of the camera's look point, respectively.
\item l/i/o increase the value of the x/y/z position of the camera's look point, respectively.
\end{my_itemize}
