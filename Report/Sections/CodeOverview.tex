\section{Overview of the Program}
\subsection{Objects}
\textbf{Vector}

\textbf{Matrix}

\textbf{Vertex}

\textbf{Triangle}

\textbf{Camera}

\textbf{Loader}

\subsection{Renderer}

how does renderer draw (when)

drawing process
	(calculate camera transforms, see \ref{Overview_Math_Single})
	(foreach triangle : update triangle according to camera, draw triangle based on view points)
	(only draws lines, not points)

\subsection{Math}

vertices are given the camera and calculate their own screen points (instead of renderer doing so) [point out problem with calculating points that are offscreen]

no frustum culling

\subsubsection{Single calculation}
\label{Overview_Math_Single}
One calculation of camera transforms per draw
