\section{Introduction}
\label{Intro}
This report is the result of a smaller project to implement a 3D wireframe renderer in the Game Engines, E2013 course at IT-University of Copenhagen.

The project had the following constraints: Transforms and rendering must be implemented in software without using DirectX or OpenGL functions. The use of an existing line-drawing API and an existing library for basic matrix math was allowed.

The wireframe renderer is implemented in C\# (using Windows Forms) based on the transforms and pseudo-code from the "Overview of transforms used in rendering"\footnote{https://blog.itu.dk/MGAE-E2013/files/2013/09/transforms.pdf} tutorial by Mark Nelson. The implementation of the matrix (and multiplication of matrixes) is taken from dev.bratched.com\footnote{http://dev.bratched.com/en/fun-with-matrix-multiplication-and-unsafe-code/}.

I have worked closely on the design of the code for the renderer with Jacob Grooss (jcgr@itu.dk) on this project.
